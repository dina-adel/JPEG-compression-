# Image JPEG Compression
*Undergraduate Information Theory Course*

This project is an implementation of the DCT-based JPEG image Compression. 
To do the compression, we implemented the DCT algorithm,
quantization, run length encoding/decoding and 
huffman encoder/decoder from scratch and used them.
